<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Stephen La Guerre, and I am an Electrical Engineer with the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission, where I have been employed since 2016.</p>

<p>In my current role, I work collaboratively with a team of System Analysts and Software Developers within the Commission’s Information Systems Department to 
  design and implement the organization’s first in-house developed Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), known as the TWMS (T&TEC Work Management System).</p>

<p>This initiative demands a strong command of programming principles, coupled with a thorough understanding of the Commission’s work planning, scheduling procedures,
   and asset management methodologies.</p>

<p>Previously, I managed the maintenance of the Central Jurisdiction’s electrical grid and oversaw emergency breakdown responses, a portfolio I held from 2016 to 2024.
   With a strong commitment to reliability and operational efficiency, my work in this capacity ensured the continuity of power supply within a critical infrastructure environment.</p>

<p>My core expertise lies in programming and analytical problem-solving, honed through addressing both routine operations and complex, unforeseen challenges. Working closely with
   multidisciplinary teams, I have consistently upheld the highest standards of operational excellence, contributing to the Commission’s mission of delivering dependable electricity
    to the nation.</p>
